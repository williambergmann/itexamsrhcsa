1. Configure the Apache web server (`httpd`).
Download a file from `http://instructor.example.com/pub/serverX.html` (assume accessible or create dummy) and save it as the default index page (`/var/www/html/index.html`).
Ensure the httpd service is running and enabled to start automatically on boot.
Ensure the firewall allows HTTP traffic.

2. Create a new LVM Volume Group (choose a name, e.g., `vg0`) using available storage (assume ~500 MiB needed).
Set the Physical Extent (PE) size for this VG to 16 MiB.
Within this VG, create a Logical Volume named `lv0` with a size of exactly 20 extents (320 MiB).
Format `lv0` with the ext3 filesystem (or ext4).
Configure it to be mounted persistently and automatically at boot on the directory `/data`.
(Note potential conflict with previous uses of /data).

3. Download the file `ftp://instructor.example.com/pub/testfile` (assume available or create dummy).
Find all lines within the downloaded file that contain any of the characters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', or 'e'.
Write only these matching lines to the file `/mnt/answer`, maintaining their original order from the source file.
Ensure the target directory `/mnt` exists.

4. Ensure that SELinux is configured to operate in `enforcing` mode persistently across system reboots.
(Same as Q75).

5. Configure a new YUM/DNF software repository using the base URL `http://server.domain11.example.com/pub/x86_64/Server`.
Ensure GPG checking is disabled (`gpgcheck=0`) and the repository is enabled (`enabled=1`).
Verify the repository is listed by DNF/YUM.
(Same as Q96).

6. Resize the existing LVM logical volume named `vo` and its underlying filesystem to approximately 290 MiB (accept sizes between 260 MiB and 320 MiB).
Ensure the filesystem contents remain intact and the filesystem is resized to match the new logical volume size.
(Assume 'vo' exists, is mounted, VG has space or is extended, and filesystem type supports resize).
(Similar to Q97).

7. Create a group named `adminuser`.
Create users `natasha` and `harry`, making `adminuser` a supplementary group for both.
Create user `sarah` with the login shell set to `/sbin/nologin` and ensure `sarah` is NOT a member of `adminuser`.
Set the password for `natasha`, `harry`, and `sarah` to 'redhat'.
(Same as Q98).

8. Copy the file `/etc/fstab` to `/var/tmp/fstab`.
Configure its permissions and ACLs as follows:
Owner must be `root`, group must be `root`.
No user should have execute permission via standard Unix permissions.
User `natasha` must have read and write permissions.
User `harry` must have no permissions (neither read nor write nor execute).
All other users (present and future) must have read permission.
(Similar to Q99, omitting bob).

9. Configure a scheduled task for the user `natasha` to run the command `/bin/echo hiya` every day at 14:23.
Ensure the cron daemon (`crond`) is running and enabled.
(Same as Q100).

10. Create a directory named `/home/admins`.
Set its group owner to `adminuser`.
Ensure that members of the group `adminuser` can read, write, and access files within this directory, but other users (excluding root) cannot.
Configure the directory so that any new files or subdirectories created inside `/home/admins` automatically inherit `adminuser` as their group owner.
(Same as Q101).
