1. Add a new 2 GiB swap partition to the system using available disk space.
Ensure the swap space is activated.
Configure the system so this new swap partition is used automatically on boot.
Do not affect any existing swap configurations.

2. Enable IP forwarding for IPv4 permanently on the system.
Ensure the setting is active in the running kernel configuration.

3. Add the kernel boot parameter `kmcrl=5` to the default kernel entry in the bootloader configuration.
Ensure this change is persistent across reboots.

4. Install an updated kernel package (assume available from configured repositories or a provided RPM).
Configure the bootloader so this newly installed kernel becomes the default option for booting.
Ensure the previously booted kernel remains available as a secondary boot option.

5. Configure the system firewall using `firewalld` to permanently REJECT all incoming traffic originating from the source network `172.25.0.0/16`.
Ensure the rule is active in the running firewall configuration.

6. Configure a new YUM/DNF software repository.
Create a repository file (e.g., `/etc/yum.repos.d/instructor.repo`).
Set the base URL to `http://instructor.example.com/pub/rhel6/dvd`.
Disable GPG checking for this repository (`gpgcheck=0`).
Verify the repository is listed by DNF/YUM.

7. Configure the system's default IPv4 gateway to `192.168.0.254`.
Ensure this setting is persistent for the primary network connection.

8. Add a new 100 MiB swap partition to the system using available disk space.
Ensure the swap space is activated.
Configure the system so this new swap partition is used automatically on boot.

9. Configure the primary network interface (e.g., eth0 or equivalent) with a static IPv4 configuration.
Set the gateway to `192.168.0.254`.
(Assume appropriate IP/Netmask should also be set if needed, focus is gateway persistence).
Ensure these settings are persistent.

10. Shrink the existing LVM logical volume `/dev/vo/myvol` and its underlying filesystem to a size between 200 MiB and 210 MiB.
Assume the filesystem type supports shrinking (e.g., ext4, NOT XFS) and is currently larger.
Ensure no data is lost during the process.
(Note: This requires the filesystem to be unmounted during the resize process).
