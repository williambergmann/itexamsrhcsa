1. Increase the size of the existing LVM logical volume `/dev/test0/testvolume1` by exactly 200 MiB.
Ensure the filesystem on the volume is also resized online to use the new space.
(Assume the LV exists, is mounted, and its VG has sufficient free space).

2. A logical volume `/dev/test0/lvtestvolume` is mounted on `/data`.
Increase the size of this logical volume by exactly 5 GiB.
Add a new partition (assume space exists or a new disk is added), create a PV, and extend the 'test0' volume group if necessary to accomplish this.
Ensure the filesystem on `/data` is resized to use the added space.

3. Configure the system as an NIS client for the domain 'RHCE' using the NIS server `server1.example.com`.
Ensure NIS user accounts (like nisuser2001) can be resolved.
Configure autofs to automatically mount NFS home directories under `/rhome/stationx` (replace 'x' with station number, assume '1' for testing).
Accessing `/rhome/station1/nisuser2001` should mount `192.168.0.254:/rhome/station1/nisuser2001` using options -rw,soft,intr.
Ensure autofs service is running and enabled.

4. Configure the permissions of the directory `/data` so that only the owner user and members of the owning group have full read, write, and execute access.
Other users should have no access.

5. Configure the directory `/data` so that any new files or subdirectories created within it automatically inherit the group ownership of the `/data` directory itself.

6. Enable IP forwarding for IPv4 permanently on the system.
Ensure the setting is active in the running kernel configuration.
(Same as Q43).

7. Create a user named 'eric'.
Configure this user's account so they cannot log in interactively via a shell.

8. Configure autofs to automatically mount the NFS share `server1.example.com:/data` when the directory `/mnt/data` is accessed.
Set the mount timeout to 50 seconds and use mount options -rw,soft,intr.
Ensure the autofs service is running and enabled.
(Note potential conflict with previous uses of /mnt/data).

9. Increase the size of the existing LVM logical volume `/dev/vg0/lv1` from its current size (assume 100MB) to exactly 500 MiB.
Ensure the filesystem on the volume is also resized online to use the new space.
(Assume the LV exists, is mounted, and its VG has sufficient free space).

10. Create a new partition of exactly 100 MiB on an available disk.
Format this partition with the ext3 filesystem (or ext4 if ext3 tools unavailable).
Configure it to be mounted persistently and automatically at boot on the directory `/data`.
(Note potential conflict with previous uses of /data).
