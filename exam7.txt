1. Describe the process to reset the root password if it is unknown, by interrupting the boot process using the GRUB bootloader.
(Note: This task describes a procedure, direct grading is not feasible).

2. Configure the system's logging service (rsyslog) to accept log messages from remote hosts over the network.
Ensure the necessary network ports (e.g., 514/udp, 514/tcp) are open in the firewall if needed.

3. Configure the system's DNS client settings to use 192.168.0.254 as the primary nameserver.
Ensure this setting is persistent.

4. Install the package `zsh` from an RPM file located at ftp://server1.example.com/pub/updates/zsh-*.rpm (assume server is 192.168.0.254 and anonymous FTP works, or file is otherwise available).

5. Ensure the NFS server service (`nfs-server`) and its dependency (`rpcbind`) are running and enabled on the system.
Verify that any NFS shares configured in `/etc/exports` are correctly exported and accessible (e.g., using `showmount -e localhost`).
Ensure the firewall allows necessary NFS traffic.

6. Create a new logical partition (using an extended partition if necessary on MBR) of exactly 100 MiB on an available disk.
Format this partition with the ext3 filesystem (or ext4).
Configure it to be mounted persistently and automatically at boot on the directory `/data`.
(Note potential conflict with previous uses of /data).

7. Configure the Apache web server (`httpd`) to serve HTTPS traffic on port 443 for the virtual host `www.rhce.com` (associated with IP 192.100.0.2, though specific IP binding is less common now).
Ensure necessary SSL modules are enabled and basic SSL configuration directives (SSLEngine on, certificate/key paths) are present.
(Assume SSL certificate/key files exist at specified paths or default locations).
Ensure the httpd service is running and enabled, and the firewall allows HTTPS traffic.

8. Configure the system's primary network interface with a static IPv4 address based on a station number (e.g., 172.24.0.<station_num>) and set the default gateway to 172.24.254.254.
Ensure the settings are persistent.
(Assume station number 1 for testing: IP 172.24.0.1).

9. Configure the system's DNS client settings to use 172.24.254.254 as the primary nameserver.
Ensure this setting is persistent.
(Similar to Q64/Q3).

10. Enable IP forwarding for IPv4 permanently on the system.
Ensure the setting is active in the running kernel configuration.
(Same as Q43/Q57).
