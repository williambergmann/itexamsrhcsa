1. Configure hostname to station.domain40.example.com, IP address to 172.24.40.40/24, gateway to 172.24.40.1, and DNS server to 172.24.40.1 for the primary network interface. Ensure settings are persistent.
2. Create users named harry, natasha, and tom. Add harry and natasha to the supplementary group 'admin'. Set tom's login shell to /sbin/nologin.
3. Create a directory named /home/admins. Set its group owner to 'admin'. Configure permissions so the owner and group members can read, write, and execute, but others have no access. Ensure new files created within /home/admins automatically inherit the 'admin' group ownership.
4. Configure a scheduled task to run the command '/bin/echo hello' every day at 14:23 for the root user.
5. Find all files on the entire system owned by the user 'harry' and copy them (preserving attributes if possible) into the directory /opt/dir. Ensure the target directory exists.
6. Find all lines containing the exact text "abcde" within the file /etc/testfile and write only those lines to the file /tmp/testfile, maintaining their original order. (Assume /etc/testfile exists for testing purposes).
7. Add a new 2 GiB swap partition to the system. Ensure it is activated and configured to be used automatically on boot, without affecting any existing swap space.
8. Create a user named alex with UID 1234 and set their password to 'alex111'.
9. Configure the system to use a local YUM/DNF repository located at file:///mnt (create a simple repo file named /etc/yum.repos.d/local.repo for this). Install the 'vsftpd' package using any available repository. Configure vsftpd to allow anonymous downloads (ensure anonymous_enable=YES in vsftpd.conf). Ensure the vsftpd service is running and enabled.
10. Install the 'httpd' package. Create a simple file /var/www/html/index.html with the content "Welcome". Configure httpd (e.g., ensure the main configuration listens) so that accessing the server's primary IP address serves the content from /var/www/html/. Ensure the httpd service is running and enabled and firewall allows http access.
