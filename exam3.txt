1. Create a user named 'user1' with UID 601 and set their login shell to /sbin/nologin. Set the password for 'user1' to 'redhat'.
2. Create users named 'user2' and 'user3'. Add both 'user2' and 'user3' to the supplementary group 'admin'. Set the password for both users to 'redhat'.
3. Copy the file /etc/fstab to /var/tmp/fstab. Using Access Control Lists (ACLs), configure permissions so that user 'user1' has read, write, and execute permissions, while user 'user2' has no permissions at all on /var/tmp/fstab.
4. Configure a scheduled task for the user 'natasha' to run the command '/bin/echo "file"' every day at 14:23.
5. Configure a new YUM/DNF software repository. Create a repository file (e.g., /etc/yum.repos.d/server.repo) with the base URL http://server.domain11.example.com/pub/x86_64/Server. Disable GPG checking for this repository (gpgcheck=0). Verify the repository is listed by DNF/YUM.
6. Resize the existing LVM logical volume named 'vo' so that its filesystem size is approximately 290 MiB (accept sizes between 270 MiB and 320 MiB). Ensure the filesystem contents remain intact and the filesystem is resized to match the new logical volume size. (Assume 'vo' exists, is mounted, and its VG has space or can be extended).
7. Create a group named 'adminuser'. Create users 'natasha' and 'harry', making 'adminuser' a supplementary group for both. Create user 'sarah' with the login shell set to /sbin/nologin and ensure sarah is NOT a member of 'adminuser'. Set the password for natasha, harry, and sarah to 'redhat'.
8. Copy the file /etc/fstab to /var/tmp/fstab. Configure its permissions and ACLs as follows: Owner must be root, group must be root. No user should have execute permission. User 'natasha' must have read and write permissions. User 'harry' must have no permissions. All other users (present and future) must have read permission.
9. Configure a scheduled task for the user 'natasha' to run the command '/bin/echo hiya' every day at 14:23. Ensure the cron daemon (crond) is running and enabled.
10. Create a directory named /home/admins. Set its group owner to 'adminuser'. Ensure that members of the group 'adminuser' can read, write, and access files within this directory. Configure the directory so that any new files or subdirectories created inside /home/admins automatically inherit 'adminuser' as their group owner.
