1. Configure the system to authenticate user accounts against an LDAP server located at ldap://instructor.example.com with the search base DN dc=example,dc=com. Ensure LDAP passwords are used for authentication and that user ldapuser40 can be successfully queried (e.g., using getent). A certificate may be needed (assume it's available if required by the tool).
2. Configure autofs to automatically mount NFS home directories. Specifically, accessing /rhome/<user> should mount the corresponding directory from 172.24.40.10:/rhome/<user> (e.g., /rhome/ldapuser40 mounts 172.24.40.10:/rhome/ldapuser40). Use NFS mount options -rw,soft,intr. Ensure the autofs service is running and enabled.
3. Configure the system's time synchronization client (chronyd) to use 172.24.40.10 as its primary time source. Ensure the time service is running and enabled.
4. Extend the existing LVM logical volume named 'vo' to a total size of approximately 300 MiB (accept sizes between 280 MiB and 320 MiB). Ensure the filesystem on the volume is also resized to use the new space. (Assume 'vo' exists, is mounted, and its VG has enough space or can be extended).
5. Create a new LVM Volume Group named 'vg1' with a Physical Extent (PE) size of 16 MiB using available storage (assume device(s) like /dev/sda7, /dev/sda8 are available or add new storage). Within 'vg1', create a Logical Volume named 'lvm02' with a size of exactly 50 extents. Format 'lvm02' with the ext4 filesystem and configure it to be mounted persistently and automatically at boot on /mnt/data.
6. Install a kernel package version 2.6.36.7.1 (assume available via local RPM or repo). Configure the bootloader (GRUB) so that this newly installed kernel is the default kernel booted, but ensure the previously existing kernel remains available as a boot option.
7. Create a new partition of exactly 512 MiB on an available disk (e.g., /dev/vda). Format this partition with the ext4 filesystem and configure it to be mounted persistently and automatically at boot on /mnt/data. (Note: Overlaps mount point with Q15/Q18, clarify which takes precedence or use different mount point if needed - using /mnt/data2 for this question).
8. Create a new LVM Volume Group named 'vg1' with a Physical Extent (PE) size of 8 MiB using available storage (e.g., /dev/vda6). Within 'vg1', create a Logical Volume named 'lvshare' with a size of exactly 50 extents (resulting size should be 400MiB). Format 'lvshare' with the ext4 filesystem and configure it to be mounted persistently and automatically at boot on /mnt/data. (Note: Overlaps VG name and mount point with Q15/Q17, clarify or use vg2/lvshare2/mnt/data3 for this question).
9. Download the file ftp://192.168.0.254/pub/boot.iso to /root/boot.iso (assume FTP server is accessible or file exists). Configure the system to persistently mount this ISO file automatically at boot on the directory /media/cdrom using a loop device.
10. Create a group named 'admin' with a specific Group ID (GID) of 600.
