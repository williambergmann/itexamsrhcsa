1. Install an updated kernel package available from `http://server.domain11.example.com/pub/updates` (assume repo is configured or RPM is available).
Configure the bootloader so this new kernel is the default boot option.
Ensure the previously booted kernel remains available as a secondary boot option.
(Similar to Q31/45/85).

2. Configure the system as an LDAP client.
Authenticate against `ldap://ldap.example.com` (derived from Base DN).
Use the Base DN `dc=domain11,dc=example,dc=com`.
Use the CA certificate from `http://host.domain11.example.com/pub/domain11.crt` for TLS encryption.
Ensure LDAP provides account and authentication info.
Verify user `ldapuser11` can be resolved (e.g., using `getent`).
(Password for ldapuser11 is 'password').

3. Configure the system's time synchronization client (chronyd) to use `server.domain11.example.com` as its NTP server.
Ensure the time service is running and enabled.

4. Configure autofs to automatically mount NFS home directories under `/rhome`.
Accessing `/rhome/ldapuser11` should mount `host.domain11.example.com:/rhome/ldapuser11` with options allowing read-write access (e.g., `rw,sync`).
Ensure the autofs service is running and enabled.

5. Create a user named `alex` with UID 3400.
Set the password for `alex` to `redhat`.

6. Add a new swap partition of approximately 754 MiB to the system using available disk space.
Ensure the swap space is activated.
Configure the system so this new swap partition is used automatically on boot.
Do not affect any existing swap configurations.

7. Find all files on the entire system owned by the user `ira`.
Copy these found items, preserving their attributes, into the directory `/root/findresults`.
Ensure the target directory exists and user `ira` exists for testing.

8. Find all lines containing the exact string "seismic" within the file `/usr/share/dict/words`.
Write only these matching lines to the file `/root/wordlist`, maintaining their original order and ensuring no blank lines are added.

9. Create a bzip2 compressed tar archive named `/root/backup.tar.bz2`.
The archive must contain the complete contents of the `/usr/local` directory.

10. Create a new LVM Volume Group named `datastore` with a Physical Extent (PE) size of 16 MiB using available storage.
Within `datastore`, create a Logical Volume named `database` with a size of exactly 50 extents.
Format `database` with the ext3 filesystem (or ext4).
Configure it to be mounted persistently and automatically at boot on `/mnt/database`.
(Note potential conflict with previous uses of /mnt/database).
