1. Install an updated kernel package available from the repository at http://server.domain11.example.com/pub/updates (assume this repo provides a kernel newer than the currently running one). Configure the bootloader so this new kernel is the default boot option, while ensuring the original kernel remains available for selection at boot time.
2. Configure the system to authenticate user accounts against an LDAP server located at ldap://server.domain11.example.com with the search base DN dc=example,dc=com, using the CA certificate http://server.domain11.example.com/pub/EXAMPLE-CA-CERT for TLS encryption. Ensure LDAP passwords are used for authentication and that user 'ldapuser1' can be successfully queried (e.g., using getent). (Password for ldapuser1 is 'password').
3. Configure the system's time synchronization client (chronyd) to use 'classroom.example.com' as its NTP server. Ensure the time service is running and enabled.
4. Configure autofs to automatically mount NFS home directories under /home/guests. Accessing /home/guests/ldapuserX (where X is a number) should mount server.domain11.example.com:/home/guests/ldapuserX with read-write permissions. Ensure the autofs service is running and enabled.
5. Create a user named 'iar' with UID 3400 and set their password to 'redhat'.
6. Add a new 500 MiB swap partition to the system using available disk space. Ensure it is activated and configured to be used automatically on boot, without affecting any existing swap space.
7. Find all files on the entire system owned by the user 'jack' and copy them (preserving attributes if possible) into the directory /root/findresults. Ensure the target directory exists.
8. Find all lines containing the exact string "seismic" within the file /usr/share/dict/words and write only those lines to the file /root/lines.txt, maintaining their original order and ensuring no blank lines are added.
9. Create a bzip2 compressed tar archive named /root/backup.tar.bz2 containing the complete contents of the /usr/local directory.
10. Create a new LVM Volume Group named 'datastore' with a Physical Extent (PE) size of 16 MiB using available storage. Within 'datastore', create a Logical Volume named 'database' with a size of exactly 50 extents. Format 'database' with the ext3 filesystem and configure it to be mounted persistently and automatically at boot on /mnt/database.
