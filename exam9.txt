1. Create a swap *file* named `/swapfile` with a size of 600 MiB.
Activate this swap file.
Configure the system so this swap file is used automatically on boot.

2. Create a group named `admin`.
Create users named `mary` and `alice`, adding both to the supplementary group `admin`.
Create a user named `bobby` with the login shell set to `/sbin/nologin` and ensure `bobby` is NOT a member of the `admin` group.
Set the password for mary, alice, and bobby to 'password'.

3. Create the directory path `/common/admin`.
Set its group owner to `admin`.
Configure permissions so the owner and members of the `admin` group have full read, write, and execute access, while other users have no access.
Ensure that any new files or subdirectories created inside `/common/admin` automatically inherit `admin` as their group owner.

4. Install an updated kernel package available from `ftp://instructor.example.com/pub/updates` (assume FTP access works or package is otherwise available).
Configure the bootloader so this new kernel is the default boot option, while ensuring the original kernel remains available for selection at boot time.
(Similar to Q31/Q45).

5. Configure a scheduled task for the user `mary` to run the command `/bin/echo "Hello World."` every day at 14:23.

6. Configure the system as an LDAP client to authenticate against the LDAP directory provided by `192.168.0.254`.
Ensure user accounts like `ldapuserX` (where X matches the local station number, assume 1 for testing) can be resolved via `getent`.
(Assume Base DN and certificate details are handled by the configuration tool or provided elsewhere).

7. Configure autofs to automatically mount NFS home directories under `/home/guests`.
Accessing `/home/guests/ldapuserX` (where X is a number) should mount `instructor.example.com:/home/guests/ldapuserX` (assume instructor.example.com is 192.168.0.254) with read-write permissions.
Ensure the autofs service is running and enabled.
(Similar to Q34/Q54).

8. Copy the file `/etc/fstab` to `/var/tmp/fstab`.
Configure its permissions and ACLs as follows:
Owner must be `root`, group must be `root`.
User `mary` must have read and write permissions.
User `alice` must have read and execute permissions (Note: Execute on fstab is unusual, but following Q).
Create user `bob` with UID 1000 (or check if exists and UID matches). User `bob` must have read and write permissions.
All other users (present and future) must have read permission.
Ensure no user has execute permission via standard Unix permissions (though ACL might grant it to alice).

9. Configure the system's time synchronization client (chronyd) using available default servers or a specified server if provided elsewhere.
Ensure the time service (`chronyd`) is running and enabled.
(Generic NTP setup task).

10. Install the `vsftpd` package.
Configure the vsftpd service to allow anonymous FTP logins and downloads.
Ensure the vsftpd service is running and enabled to start automatically on boot.
Ensure the firewall allows necessary FTP traffic (passive/active ports might be needed).
